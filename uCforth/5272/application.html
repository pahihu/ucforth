<h3>Application startup</h3>
<p>
We are adding code to the application forth vocabulary.
If we add a forth word in the library after this the new lib
forth word will be linked back to the application.
This is not allowed. So this sits in it's own file a file that
is loaded last, a file that is called <i>application.html</i>.
</p>

<p>
This is the data stack, if you need to replace with fast memeory at run time
set _%data_stack_end and abort, or set data_stack_end and using code set S.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
host&forth
ram_create %data_stack #min_data_stack ram_allot
</code>
</pre>
<p>
This is the code called by the Bflt loader, this happens because the
address of this code is patched into the Bflt header.
</p>
<p>
We can't go to the end of the %data_stack area because the xcompile Bflt
code assumes you want to write after the address.
If the stack is the last defined data item and you
point to the end the xcompile Bflt code will complain your address is out of range.

	\ D5 is set to the base address of the data segment in
	\ include/asm-m68knommu/processor.h we must copy the value
	\ to DP ( A5). The C startup code does this in
	\ lib/libc/m69k/crt0.S.
	\ The signal code makes sure DP ( A5) is set to the same value
	\ before calling a signal routine. It is all a bit inconsistant.
