<h5>ANS 9.6.1.0875 CATCH</h5>
<p>EXCEPTION</p>
<p>( i*x xt -- j*x 0 | i*x n )</p>
<p>
Push an exception frame on the exception stack and then execute the
execution token xt (as with EXECUTE) in such a way that control can
be transferred to a point just after CATCH if THROW is executed
during the execution of xt.
</p>
<p>
If the execution of xt completes normally (i.e., the exception
frame pushed by this CATCH is not popped by an execution of THROW)
pop the exception frame and return zero on top of the data stack,
above whatever stack items would have been returned by xt EXECUTE.
Otherwise, the remainder of the execution semantics are given by THROW.
</p>
<p>
The ansi standard requires the input spec to fall back to what it was 
when catch was executed. This does not happen. If it did the kenrel
couldn't use catch and throw to tidy up the i/o state as catch and throw
would be screwing around with it.
