Given the address of a character string,
the number of characters and the <i>wid</i> return the address
of the thread that should contain the word.

<a name="SEARCH-WORDLIST"></a>
<h5>ANS 16.6.1.2192 SEARCH-WORDLIST</h5>
<p>( c-addr u wid -- 0 | xt 1 | xt -1 )</p>
<p>
Find the definition identified by the string c-addr u in the word-list
identified by wid. If the definition is not found, return zero.
If the definition is found, return its execution token xt and one (1)
if the definition is immediate, minus-one (-1) otherwise.
</p>
<p>
The string argument to SEARCH-WORDLIST is represented by c-addr u,
rather than by just c-addr as with FIND. The committee wishes to
establish c-addr u as the preferred representation of a string on
the stack, and has adopted that representation for all new functions
that accept string arguments. While this decision may cause the
implementation of SEARCH-WORDLIST to be somewhat more difficult in
existing systems, the committee feels that the additional difficulty
is minor.
</p>
<p>
When SEARCH-WORDLIST fails to find the word, it does not return
the string, as does FIND. This is in accordance with the general
principle that Forth words consume their arguments.
</p>

No truncated names here. The head is the name string with no
truncation

<a name="FIND"></a>
<h5>FIND</h5>
<p>ANS 6.1.1550 FIND</p>
<p>( c-addr -- c-addr 0  |  xt 1  |  xt -1 )</p>
<p>
Find the definition named in the counted string at c-addr.
If the definition is not found, return c-addr and zero.
If the definition is found, return its execution token xt.
If the definition is immediate, also return one (1), otherwise
also return minus-one (-1). For a given string, the values
returned by FIND while compiling may differ from those returned
while not compiling.
</p>
<p>
One of the more difficult issues which the Committee took on was the
problem of divorcing the specification of implementation mechanisms
from the specification of the Forth language. Three basic implementation
approaches can be quickly enumerated:
</p>
<p>
<dl>
<dt>1) Threaded code mechanisms.
<dd>These are the traditional approaches to
	implementing Forth, but other techniques may be used.
<dt>2) Subroutine threading with macro-expansion (code copying).
<dd>Short routines,
	like the code for DUP, are copied into a definition rather than compiling a
	JSR reference.

<dt>3) Native coding with optimization.
<dd>This may include stack optimization
(replacing such phrases as SWAP ROT + with one or two machine instructions,
for example), parallelization (the trend in the newer RISC chips is to
have several functional subunits which can execute in parallel), and so on.
</dl>
<p>
The initial requirement (inherited from Forth-83) that compilation addresses
be compiled into the dictionary disallowed type 2 and type 3 implementations.
</p>
<p>
Type 3 mechanisms and optimizations of type 2 implementations were
hampered by the explicit specification of immediacy or non-immediacy
of all standard words. POSTPONE allowed de-specification of immediacy
or non-immediacy for all but a few Forth words whose behavior must be
STATE-independent.
</p>
<p>
One type 3 implementation, Charles Moore's cmForth, has both compiling
and interpreting versions of many Forth words. At the present, this
appears to be a common approach for type 3 implementations. The Committee
felt that this implementation approach must be allowed. Consequently,
it is possible that words without interpretation semantics can be found
only during compilation, and other words may exist in two versions: a
compiling version and an interpreting version. Hence the values returned
by FIND may depend on STATE, and ' and ['] may be unable to find words
without interpretation semantics.
