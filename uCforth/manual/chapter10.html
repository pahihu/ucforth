<h1>COLDFORTH MANUAL CHAPTER 10</h1>
<h2>Html Server</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The html server listens to TCP/IP port 80. When a remote machines connects
the server starts up another task and gives the open connection
to that created task to look after. Lets call the created task a servelet.
</P>
<p>
The servelet reads the remote request and replies as requested.
</p>
<p>
Three request methods are supported. The method used depends on the file extension.
</p>
<h3>Headers and content</h3>
<h4>Request</h4>
<p>
A <i>HTTP</i> request from a client ( your browser) to a  server contains a <b>header</b>, and if
a post <b>content</b>. The header is separated from the content by an empty line.
A request may may look something like this.
</p>
<pre><samp>
GET /index.shtml HTTP/1.0
Accept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, */*
Accept-Language: en-us
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 4.0; Windows NT)
Host: rack
Connection: Keep-Alive

</samp></pre>
<p>
The header gives the server additional information to use when fullfilling the request.
</p>
<h4>The responce</h4>
<p>
The responce contains header and content. If the server is serving a html file it will
generate the header and then send the contents of the file as content.
</p>
<p>
If the server is requested to serve a script or to execute the word it generates no header,
that is left up to the or the word or script.
</p>
<h3>.HTML</h3>
<p>
As has been mentioned, the server looks after the sending of the header, and
uses the contents of the file as the contents.
</p>

<p>
A search for the file is done in the directory <i>flash/html</i>.
</p>
<p>
There is nothing complicated about a html; file. Start it with:
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN"&gt;<br>
and continue with standard &lt;HTML&gt; text.
<p>
<h3>.shtml</h3>
<p>
The servelet searches the <i>flash/html</i> for the request files and <samp>INCLUDES</samp> it.
Hopefully the user has written
a nice scripting file. The following script displays the current value of %ticks.
</p>
<samp><pre>
\ n code
DUP #post = [IF]
   $" Can't post" .html_not_allowed
[ELSE]
   .html_ok
   .( Connection: close) CR
   .( Connection-Type: text/html) CR
   \ terminate the header
   CR
   DUP #get = [IF]
       \ the document
       $" Scripted example" .html_header
       &lt;BODY&gt;
       &lt;h1&gt;Scripted&lt;/h1&gt;
       &lt;$
       .( Current clock: ) %ticks @ .h
       $&gt;
       &lt;br&gt;  the end
       &lt;/BODY&gt;
       &lt;/HTML&gt;
       &lt;$
    [THEN]
    html_close
[THEN]
2DROP

</pre></samp>
<p>
The script is called with two stack parameters, a <i>code</i> and a <i>count</i>. The code can take the
value <i>#post</i>, <i>#head</i> and <i>#get</i>.
</p>
<h4>#post</h4>
<p>
If the code is <i>#post</i>, n gives the content length in
bytes. You read the content from standard input using the standard input words.
</p>
<h4>#head</h4>
<p>
If the code is <i>#head</i> the requester only wants you to send the head. The contents is not sent.
This method is used by search engines and such like to reduce overall traffic.
</p>
<h4>#get</h4>
<p>
This code expects the script to send both the head and the content.
</p>
<p>
In the example we have executed the word <i>html_close</i> if the contents is sent. If you
want to keep the link alive you have to send the header field <i>content-length</i>, you
can't send this field unless you know the content length. The servelet uses the file length
as the content length when returning an html file. You as the author of the script have to
pre determine the content length or close the connection after sending the content.
</p>
<p>
The script should be written so it sends the desired responce to the standard output.
</p>
<h3>.4th</h3>
<p>
If the servelet receives a request for a .4th file it searches for a forth word with that name in
the <i>&html_words</i> vocabulary. The kernel defines the word <i>index.4th</i>. This word
lists all words defined in the <i>&html_words</i> vocabulary.
</p>
<p>
The follwoing is the definition for <i>index.4th</i>
</p>
<pre><samp>


\ you have to add the word to the &html_words vocabulary.
ALSO
&html_words

        \ have to generate error message for post
        DUP #post = IF
                $" Can't POST to html files" .html_not_allowed \ 405
                2DROP
                EXIT
        THEN

        \ word has to create header
        .html_ok
        ." Connection: close" CR
        ." Content-Type: text/html" CR

        \ terminate the header
        CR
        \ length code(--
        #get = IF
                \ start the html page
                $" Index of callable forth words" .html_header
                \ my html content.
                TRUE %words_html !
                ~html_words null (words)
                \ end the html text.
                .html_trailer
                \ have no idea how long it is.
                \ so the link has to be closed
        THEN
        html_close
        \ get rid of the count
        DROP

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>
The servlets are low priority tasks so they have little effect on the real time tasks. As each connection
is given it's own task complex functions do not effect the servers performance. This is particularly
important when requesting pictures. The task requesting the picture can be put to sleap while the
picture arrives.
