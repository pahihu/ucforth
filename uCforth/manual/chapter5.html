<p>
How the memory management system works is covered in <a href="./appendix1.html">Appendix 1</a>, here we talk about how to use it.
</p>
<p>
Memory management is about getting blocks of memory for temporary use from the memory management system
and <b>returning</b> it. Two situations need to be explored, returning it within the task that obtained
the memory, and returning it from another task.
</p>
<a name="standard_words"><h3>The ANSI standard words</h3></a>
<p>
The ANSI standard provides a set of words to get and return blocks of memory to the OS. Unfortunately
the standards does not tell us what to do with allocated memory should the task
fail.
</p>
<p>
<b>COLDFORTH</b> keeps track of the memory allocated by the standard words and returns it to the
system on task failure. These words should not be used if the memeory is going to be used for a buffer
that is to be passed to another task for use and destruction.
</p>
<p>
There are three standard memeory management words,
<a HREF="./source/heap_control.html#ALLOCATE">ALLOCATE</a>,
<a HREF="./source/heap_control.html#FREE">FREE</a> and
<a HREF="./source/heap_control.html#RESIZE">RESIZE</a>.
The following example show their use.
</p>
<h5>EXAMPLE</h5>
<pre><samp>
#$buffer ALLOCATE \ addr1 ior(--
$ABORT            \ give up if failed.
DUP do_stuff          \ addr1(--
#$buffer 2*       \ addr1 u1(--
\ if the buffer can be extended addr1 will equal addr2
\ if the buffer can't be extended a new buffer will be created
\ and the data copied from buffer1 to buffer2
RESIZE            \ addr2 ior
$ABORT
DUP do_stuff          \ addr2(--
FREE
</samp></pre>
<p>
<samp>RESIZE</samp> makes the management of areas that can extend over time simple to manage.
</p>
<pre><samp>
\ The systems sets ram_variables to zero on startup
ram_variable %item_offset
ram_variable %item_buffer
8  CONSTANT #item_length

: add_item  { ( item_addr --) }{
        20 CONSTANT #min_items
       }

        \ if there is no buffer get one
        %item_buffer @ not IF
                [ #min_items #item_length * ] LITERAL ALLOCATE
                $ABORT
                %item_buffer !
        THEN

        \ if item buffer is too small get bigger one
        %item_offset @ #item_length + %item_buffer @ buffer_size &gt; IF
                %item_buffer @ %item_offset @  [ #min_items #item_length * ] LITERAL +  RESIZE %item_buffer !
        THEN

        \ add the item
        %item_buffer @ %item_offset @ + #item_length MOVE
        #item_length %item_offset +!
;
</samp></pre>
<p>
The above example introduces
<a HREF="./source/heap_control.html#buffer_size">buffer_size</a>
</p>
<p>
The last example illustrates several points.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Move calculation to compile time if you can. In the above code you will find <samp>[ #min_items #item_length * ] LITERAL</samp></li>
<li>Create data structure that reduce runtime calculation, for example, using an offset instead of an item number</li>
<li>Keep the concept simple, keep code related to one concept together, good code is like English, it has paragraphs, indicate where they are.</li>
<li>Comment what you are doing in a paragraph.</li>
<li>Where you can use local constants, for example <samp>#min_items</samp> is probable only of interest to this word.</li>
<li>Keep it clear, keep it simple.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>COLDFORTH</b> buffers are self describing, <a HREF="./source/heap_control.html#buffer_size">buffer_size</a>
uses this feature. The buffer size can be longer than requested.
</p>
<p>
If %item_buffer is non zero the above codes assumes that the buffer address is valid. This is ok unless there is
an abort. If an abort happens the buffer pointed to by %item_buffer will be returned to the buffer pool.
If the code is then reused problems occure because you are using a memory area that is no longer yours.
The above code would be better written as follows.
</p>
<pre><samp>
\ The systems sets ram_variables to zero on startup
ram_variable %item_offset
ram_variable %item_buffer
8  CONSTANT #item_length

\ to be placed in a word executed only on task startup
\ Note we don test for a non zero value. If there is an address
\ stored it is because the task aborted. The abort code has
\ already returned the buffer.
: item_init
        [ #min_items #item_length * ] LITERAL ALLOCATE
        $ABORT
        %item_buffer !
;

: add_item  { ( item_addr --) }{
        20 CONSTANT #min_items
       }
        \ if item buffer is too small get bigger one
        %item_offset @ #item_length + %item_buffer @ buffer_size &gt; IF
                %item_buffer @ %item_offset @  [ #min_items #item_length * ] LITERAL +  RESIZE %item_buffer !
        THEN

        \ add the item
        %item_buffer @ %item_offset @ + #item_length MOVE
        #item_length %item_offset +!
;
</samp></pre>
<p>
This code offers two advantages.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Code can restart without error.</li>
<li>One test has been removed by the runtime code.</li>
</ul>

<a name="get_buffer"><h3>get_buffer, kill_buffer and buffer</h3></a>
<p>
Often you need memory for a short time. A buffer to do some sting manipulation, a buffer to create
the data structure needed for a binary sort, and so it goes.
<a HREF="./source/heap_control.html#get_buffer">get_buffer</a>,
<a HREF="./source/heap_control.html#kill_buffer">kill_buffer</a> and
<a HREF="./source/heap_control.html#buffer">buffer</a> are a simple to use wordset for these situations.
<p>
Buffers obtained this way are returned if the task aborts so you don't have to worry about reurning buffers
on an exception.
</p>
<p>
get_buffer and return_buffer should to be paired within a word.
The following example shows typical useage.
</p>
<pre><samp>
: .unsigned ( n --)
        #picture_min get_buffer
                S&gt;D buffer #picture_min [# #S #] TYPE
        kill_buffer
;
</samp></pre>
<p>
<samp>get_buffer</samp> and <samp>kill_buffer</samp> are fully recursive, so low level words using these words have no
effect on the use of buffers in high level words. The word buffer returns the address of the
last buffer claimed with getbuffer.
The following code may be poorly structured but it is valid.
</p>
<pre><samp>
: (.unsigned) ( n--)
        S&gt; buffer #picture_min [# #S #] TYPE
;
: .unsigned
        #picture_min get_buffer
        (.unsigned)
        kill_buffer
;
</samp></pre>
<p>
<samp>get_buffer</samp> and <samp>kill_buffer</samp> are used extensivly in the kernel.
</p>

<a name="get_free_buffer"><h3>get_free_buffer, kill_free_buffer resize_free_buffer</h3></a>
<p>
These are used if you want a buffer that is free of any system interferance. You do this if you
want to hand the buffer over to another task to use and consume. If you have given the buffer
to another task the last thing you want is the task that created the buffer returning it on an ABORT.
If you get a buffer using <samp>get_free_buffer</samp> the memeory is lost to the system unless someone
returns it. If you are using free buffers you have to consider what happens if something goes wrong.
Fortunatly <b>COLDFORTH</b> supports the catching of aborts in user code, so users can clean up on failure.
</p>
<pre><samp>

\ describe the data in the buffer
0
DUP CONSTANT #transfer_count CELL+
DUP CONSTANT #transfer_data
DROP

: transfer_data { ( add n --) }{
        variable %buffer }
        DUP #transfer_data +  get_free_buffer %buffer !
        DUP %buffer @ #transfer_count + !
        %buffer @ #transfer_data + SWAP MOVE
        %buffer @ transfer_to_other_task
;
</samp></pre>
<p>
The above example is worth some comment. Note that we have used constants to descibe the structure
of tha data in the buffer. The description of the buffer has been done in a manner that
allows the additional of fields with minimum effort. It is well worth getting into the habit of doing this.
</p>
<ul>
<li>In the code it documents the field you are trying to alter.</li>
<li>It allows the additon of fields without having to go and chase magic numbers.</li>
<li>It lays before the user how the data is arranged</li>
</ul>
<p>
The example above expects consumption of the buffer by <samp>transfer_to_other_task</samp>.
<samp>transfer_to_other_task</samp> has to fullfill the promise.
</p>
<pre><samp>
: transfer_to_other_task { variable %buffer -- }
        ['] _word_that_can_fail CATCH ?DUP IF
                %buffer @ kill_free_buffer
                $ABORT
        THEN
        %buffer @ _do_the transfer
;

</samp></pre>
<p>
In the above code the <samp>ABORT</samp> done by <samp>_word_that_can_fail</samp> is caught with <samp>CATCH</samp>
the buffer returned as promised and the <samp>ABORT</samp> continued. CATCH is discussed in
<a href="./chapter3.html#CATCH">chaper 3</a>.
</p>
<p>
You can resize a free_buffer using <samp>resize_free_buffer</samp>.
</p>

<a name="heap_errors"><h3>Heap errors</h3></a>
<p>
Introduce a heap and you run into three problems.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Programmes failing to return buffers.</li>
<li>Programmes writing over the end of the memory allocated ( buffer overrun).</li>
<li>Memory fragmentation.</li>
</ul>
<a name="hogging"><h4>Who is hogging the heap</h4></a>
<p>
Code consuming and not returning buffers is simple to detect using the diagnostic
words <samp>.buffers_used</samp> and <samp>.buffers</samp>.
</p>
<p>
<a HREF="./source/print_system_data.html#.buffers"><samp>.buffers</samp></a>
gives a summary of the buffer pool. It tells you how many buffer of each size
are available, and how many buffers of each size are in use. If useage is growing you have a problem.
</p>
<p>

<a HREF="./source/print_system_data.html#.buffers_used"><samp>.buffers_used</samp></a>
list all used buffers, one per line, along with the buffers base address, the task that
claimed the buffer and the execution token address of the word that claimed the buffer. If one word shows up over and
over again as claimer, then this is the word to suspect.
</p>
<a name="overrun"><h4>Buffer overrun</h4></a>
<p>
Buffer overrun is difficult to detect, and can lead to erratic system behavior. Directly after the buffer
is a guard cell followed by the head of the next buffer. The next head may be linked into the empty buffer
list, or may be the head of a buffer in use. If you write over the head of the next you are effecting the
execution of totally unrelated code.
</p>
<p>
At the end of each buffer is a guard cell. If a buffer is returned to the system with the
guard cell corrupted the buffer is saved of as a bad buffer, further if the card has a fault led
it is turned on.
</p>
<p>
The faulted buffer details can be view with
<a HREF="./source/print_system_data.html#.bad_buffer"><samp>.bad_buffer</samp></a>
</p>
<a name="fragmentation"><h4>Fragmentation</h4></a>
<p>
Fragmentation can be an issue if the heap is under heavy use, with demand for small
and large buffers. <a href="./appendix1.html">Appendix 1</a> describes the effort
that has been put in to prevent fragmentation problems. There is really only one
complete solution, the addition of an MMU.
