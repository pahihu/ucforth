<p>
For the serious developer understanding objects is very important
as the entire COLDFORTH I/O subsystem is object based.
</p>
<p>
Here we are going to try and remove the mysteries surrounding object programming. It
seems to be an area of computing science that has been twisted by jargon used to market instead of
inform. The <a href="./source/objects.html">code</a> that implements objects describes how things are done.
</p>
<p>
An array contains data. You can go a little further and have a data structure that contains data and
execution tokens. Execution tokens were covered in <a href="./chapter3.html#execution_token">chapter 3</a>.
The next step is object programming. <b>An object contain data and access to the functions required to
manipulate the data</b>. Nothing more and nothing less.
</p>
<p>
You can't have an object unless you have defined a class. The class is the factory, objects are the
products. Different factories produce different objects. When you build a new factory
you make a copy of an old one and extend it. Obviously you pick an old factory that nearly does
the job you want.
</p>
<p>
If you have the address of the array, you have access to the data, what functions can be used
against that data is something that has to be documented else where. If you have the address of an object
you have the data and the address of methods that can be used with the data.
</p>
<p>
It is a pretty powerful concept. Traditional programming languages give you a fixed set of general operations.
You then go about making specific functions to do your job. Object programming allows you to make
functions that deal with different sorts of data. As an example the <b>COLDFORTH</b> base_class has a print method
called <samp>:print</samp>.
When you define a new class you can <b>override</b> the <samp>:print</samp> method to suit your needs.
Code that uses <samp>:print</samp> will use your new method for objects based on your new class.
Or in other words when you write a new class,  you create a <samp>:print</samp> method
that prints out relevant information, then code that invokes the <samp>:print</samp> method
such as <samp>.obj</samp> will then print relevant information.  You have in effect extended
<samp>.obj</samp> to suit your needs.
</p>
<p>
<samp>:print</samp> is in effect a new general purpose operator that will work against many different types of data.
</p>
<a name="terms"><h3>terms</h3></a>

</ul>
<p>
Now we need to define our terms.
</p>

<a name="class"><h4>class</h4></a>

<p>
A class describes the data and methods that make up an object. A class on it own is nothing.
you have to create an object using the class for it to be useful. Each time you create an object
you create a new data area. The data area will be structured so method calls will use the methods defined in the class
from which the object was derived.
</p>
<p>
Classes are derived from a parent classes. You derive the new class from the
parent class that best suits you needs. The kernel offers three general purpose classes,
<a href="./source/objects.html#object">base_class</a>,
<a href="./source/link_class.html">link_class</a> and
<a href="./source/string_class.html">string_class</a>.

These will be described later in this chapter.
There is also a class defined for the creation of
new <a href="./source/io_common.html">device driver</a> classes
, and another for the definition of
new
<a href="./source/terminal_class.html">terminal driver</a>
classes. These and other classes are described in chapter 7.
</p>
<p>
Go back far enough and all classes are derived from <samp>base_class</samp>.
</p>
<p>
An interesting class is <a href="./source/objects.html#value_class"><samp>value_class</samp></a>, it is the class
used by <a href="./source/objects.html#VALUE"><samp>VALUE</samp></a> to create value objects.
Using a class and having <samp>VALUE</samp> create an object
provides a structure that allows
<a href="./source/objects.html#TO"><samp>TO</samp></a> ,
<a href="./source/objects.html#+to"><samp>+to</samp></a> and
<a href="./source/objects.html#&of"><samp>&of</samp></a>
to be extended to new data types in a structured manner.
This is seen in the local variable code that extends the functionality  by deriving
<a href="./source/local_variables.html#class_local_value"><samp>class_local_value</samp></a> from value_class.
</p>
<p>
We  have just stated that the base class defines a method called <samp>:print</samp>,
and that <samp>VALUE</samp> creates an object. The following code gets the object address
and uses the :print method.
<pre><samp>
VALUE fred
' fred >BODY @ .obj
</samp></pre>

<p>
The following examples shows the basic structure used to create a class.
</p>

<h5>EXAMPLE</h5>
<pre><samp>
	base_class class

        .............

	end_class link_class
</samp></pre>
<p>
In the above example the parent class is <samp>base_class</samp>. The new class is <samp>link_class</samp>
</p>
<a name="selector"><h4>selector</h4></a>
<p>
If you want to be pedantic, you use a selector to invoke a method. Lets not be pedantic, methods have names and
you use the methods name to invoke it.
</p>
<p>
<b>COLDFORTH</b> allows you to define your selectors and then use <samp>overrides</samp>
to create the methods. <b>This is not recommended</b>. Create methods not selectors, if the method is being defined
in a class that you expect to be used as the base for other classes and you expect the method to be overridden then
make the initial method perform nothing more than a stack tidy up or an abort.
</p>

<a name="method"><h4>method</h4></a>
<p>
The functions that are called through an object are no longer called functions, they are called methods.
</p>
<p>
By convention method names should start with :, for example <samp>:print</samp>, <samp>:construct</samp>.
As method names are not ansi standard words, methods names should start with a : and should continue
with lower case names.
</p>
<p>
A method always gets called through an object. In FORTH this point is clear, the top
stack item has to be a object address when invoking a method. Remember a class has no data area, calling
a method through a class has no meaning, you always call a method through an object. When you call the
method, the data area the method is using is that of the calling object. To understand object
programming you have to get clear in your mind this concept, and the difference between classes and objects.
Classes are the factory, objects are the product.
</p>
<p>
You can <a href="#class_binding"><samp>bind</samp></a> to a method in a particular class at compile time, and then call that method with
an object of that class, or derived from that class at runtime, this is covered later.
</p>
<p>
When defining a class, methods defined in the parent class can be overridden, or new methods can be added.
</p>
<h5>Creating a new method</h5>
<pre><samp>
	base_class class

        .............
		m: ( --addr )
			_%linked_objects
		; method :list_head
        ............

	end_class link_class
</samp></pre>
<p>
Be vary careful not to use <samp>method</samp> with the same name as a previously named method.
</p>
<h5>EXAMPLE</h5>
<pre> <samp>
\ <b>this is valid as :print is defined in the base_class</b>
base_class class
        m: ( offset --)
                CR SPACES
                ." fred_object | " ." Object: " this .h
        ; <b>overrides</b> :print
end_class fred_class

\ <b>this is nonsense as :print is being defined again.</b>
base_class class
        m:
                CR SPACES
                ." fred_object | " ." Object: " this .h
        ; <b>method</b> :print
end_class fred_class
</samp></pre>

<h5>EXAMPLE overriding a method</h5>
<pre><samp>
	base_class

        .............

		m: ( indent --)
			CR DUP SPACES
			." link_object | " ." Object: " this .h
			CR DUP SPACES ." Linked_objects: " this :number_of_links .h
			this :list_head @ BEGIN
				DUP
			WHILE
				OVER 4+ OVER link>object DUP this <> IF
					:print
				ELSE
					2DROP
				THEN
                                @
			REPEAT
			2DROP
			send
		; overrides :print

        .............

	end_class link_class
</samp></pre>
<p>
In the above example <samp>:print</samp> has been overridden so it prints information that is important when looking at
a linked_object.
</p>
<p>
How <samp>:print</samp> is used can be seen by looking at <a href="./source/objects.html#.obj">.obj</a>
</p>
<p>
An end_class child word ( for example <samp>link_class</samp>)returns the data field address of the class. The word <samp>class</samp> sets the system up so a class
compile can start and puts on the stack the alignment and length of the object created by the parent class.
Remember a class  extends the parent class with new methods, or overrides methods in the parent class.
<samp>instance_variable</samp> can extend the size of the object created by the new class.
<samp>end_class</samp> finishes of the new class and stores how long an object of the new class has to be.
</p>
<a name="this"><h4>this</h4></a>
<p>
As we have mentioned, a method can only be invoked through an object.
When a method is invoked a register preserved as the object base pointer is set to the object base.
The old object pointer is saved on the return stack.
</p>
<p>
Within a method you can get the base address of the object with the word <samp>this</samp>. The
use of this word can be seen in the following example.
</p>
<pre><samp>
                m: ( --)
			%%object_link <b>this</b> :list_head link_double
			\ something to indicate that it is unset
			\ has to be eight bytes.
			S" -notset-" %%cleanup_link SWAP MOVE
		; overrides :construct
</samp></pre>
<p>
In the above code <samp>:construct</samp> calls another method within the object to get the
list head.
</p>
<p>
If <samp>this</samp> is used in a FORTH word, then that word can only be called from a method. Using
<samp>this</samp> only makes sense if the object pointer register has been set, the object pointer address
is set by calling a method through an object.
</p>
<a name="object"><h4>object</h4></a>

<p>
An object has an address; if you have the object address you get access to the objects methods. The object comes
with it own data, but that is a side issue, you can only get access to and manipulate the data through methods.
</p>
<p>
Objects can be created from buffers obtained from the heap
( see <a href="./chapter5.html">chapter 5</a> for a heap discussion).
You need a class to create an object.
</p>
<h5>EXAMPLE</h5>
<pre><samp>
\ create an object on the heap.
link_class heap_object
\ use a method
zero OVER :print
\ destroy the object
heap_object_free
</samp></pre>
<p>
You can also create an object in the dictionary. <samp><a href="./source/objects.html#VALUE">VALUE</a></samp> does this.
</p>
<pre><samp>
\ create the object in the dictionary
link_class dictionary_object fred
\ use a method in the object
zero fred :print
</samp></pre>
<p>
Dictionary objects are created at compile time and exist for the duration; destruction is not an option.
</p>
<a name="messages"><h4>message</h4></a>

<p>
You often have people talking about sending object messages; this is nonsense. A message has a structure determined by
the sender. A windowing environment will send a window a message if the mouse moves into a window, out of the window,
clicks, etc. The format of the message is determined by the windowing system. If your lucky you will be
looking after the window using a OO based language and one of the methods will be able to look
after mouse messages received. A method needs
to be called with the correct parameters just as a function does. You invoke a method through an object, you
make sure you have the required stack parameters before invoking a method, and you use up the
returned stack parameters.
</p>
<a name="#multiple_inheritance"><h4>multiple inheritance</h4></a>

<p>
If implemented multiple inheritance allows you to take the methods and data area definition
from two different classes; place them in a new class and use them as one.
<b>COLDFORTH</b> does not support multiple inheritance, it does support an <samp>interface</samp>.
</p>
<a name="interface"><h4>interface</h4></a>
<p>
Allows a class to inherit a block of selectors from multiple sources ( but not the data areas).
You cannot derive an object directly
from an interface. An interface is a block of selectors that can be added to a class and if required
the method can be overridden in the class.
I think you can make a big enough mess without using interfaces. If used it is another concept that you
and your code maintainer have to understand. Think carefully before using an <samp>interface</samp>.
Also take a look at <a href="#object_pointing">vectored objects</a>.
</p>
<a name="construct"><h3>:construct</h3></a>
<p>
When the system creates an object it obtains a memory area big enough for the object, puts in place the
basic structure needed to call methods and transfers control to the objects <samp>:construct</samp> method.
The <samp>:construct</samp> method is responsible for getting the objects data area in order. If the object
has to be linked into a list, it is the <samp>:construct</samp> method that must do it.
If a instance variables have to be be preset, do it in the <samp>:construct</samp> method.
</p>
<p>
When you define a class you derive it from a parent class. The system does not call the parent
<samp>:construct</samp> methods, the child's <samp>:construct</samp> method must do so.
</p>
<p>
Don't copy the parents construct code into the child unless you have to, always call the parents <samp>:construct</samp>
method if you can. If the parents code gets altered slightly your derived code will then still work.
</p>
<h5>EXAMPLE</h5>
<p>
This construct method is from the <samp>parented_class</samp>. The <samp>parented_class</samp> is
derived from the <samp>cleanup_class</samp>. The code <samp>this [parent] :construct</samp>
calls the <samp>cleanup_class</samp> <samp>:construct</samp> method.
</p>
<pre><samp>
		m: ( parent_instance --)
			%%parent_instance !
			zero %%name> !
			this [parent] :construct
		; overrides :construct
</samp></pre>
<a name="destruct"><h3>:destruct</h3></a>
<p>
If you link an object into a list it is nice to unlink it before returning the buffer back to the
central pool.
</p>
<p>
When you use <samp>heap_object_free</samp> it calls the objects <samp>:destruct</samp> method before
returning the buffer back to the system.
</p>
<h5>EXAMPLE</h5>
<p>
This example comes from <samp>parented_class</samp>, note we call the parents <samp>:destruct</samp> method.
Also note that we set the instance variable <samp>%%name</samp> to zero in the <samp>:construct</samp> method above.
If a name gets set <samp>%%name</samp> will be non zero. The <samp>:destruct</samp> method returns the
buffer used to store the name if <samp>%%name</samp> is non zero.
</p>
<pre><samp>
		m: ( --)
			%%name> @ ?DUP IF
				kill_free_buffer
			THEN
			\ does the unlinking
			this [parent] :destruct
		; overrides :destruct
</samp></pre>

<a name="object_pointing"><h3>Vectored objects</h3></a>
<p>
Most OO languages offer multiple inheritance or interfaces. These concepts allow one to tie the methods and/or instance variables
from two different sources into one. Having taken the step you are left with a 1 to 1 relationship between the two sources.
Sometimes this is acceptable, but often it is not. I will try and explain using a <b>COLDFORTH</b> example.
</p>
<p>
All <b>COLDFORTH</b> i/o is done through objects. There are two concepts that need to be dealt with, the terminal driver
( ws60, ANSI), and the device driver. If you plug a ws60 into a serial port, the serial port still has to send serial data,
 however the string of characters required to <samp>tab</samp> the cursor is different to that required if
you have a <samp>ANSI</samp> terminal connected.
</p>
<p>
If the device driver was derived from two classes, one that described the generic driver and
another that described generic terminals, yes we would have had a chance to use multiple inheritance or
interfaces, but no we would not have had what we wanted. The opened device would have been tied to a particular
terminal type.
</p>
<p>
The solution is to store the terminal object in a device driver instance variable, and add access methods to
the device driver, the access methods invoking the methods of the stored object.
</p>
<p>
As an example we will follow <samp>tab</samp>.
</p>
<p>
<samp>tab</samp> is defined in <a href="./source/input_output.html#tab">input_output.html</a>. <samp>'output_file</samp>
is a user variable that has stored the object address of the I/O device we are sending output data to. <samp>tab</samp>
gets the object and invokes the <samp>:tab</samp> method.
</p>
<pre><samp>
: tab 'output_file @ :tab ;
</samp></pre>
<p>
<samp>:tab</samp> is defined in <a href="./source/io_common.html#tab">io_common.html</a>. The <samp>io_common</samp>
class is the base class from which all i/o drivers are derived. Note that we call the <samp>::tab</samp>
method with the device drivers object address on the stack.
</p>
<pre><samp>
		m: ( -- )
			this %%terminal @ ::tab
		; method :tab
</samp></pre>
<p>
<samp>::tab</samp> is defined in <a href="./source/terminal_class.html#tab">terminal_class.html</a>. The
definition gives an acceptable default version. That is a version that requires no addition control codes.
Note that this is called with the device drivers object address on the stack, and the device driver is used to
output the data.
</p>
<pre><samp>
                CREATE _blank  BL 8 RSHIFT tw,
		m: { ( line char ) variable %object -- }

<p>
<samp>ansi</samp> is a terminal driver. The code for <samp>ansi</samp> is defined in
<a href="./source/ansi.html#ansi">ansi.html</a>. ansi overrides the ::tab code as follows.
</p>
<pre><samp>
		| : _nnn { ( n ) variable %handle -- }
			BASE @ >R DECIMAL

<p>
The word ansi calls the driver method :!terminal as follows.
</p>
<pre><samp>
: ansi
	ansi_class 'output_file @ :!terminal

</samp></pre>
<p>
A class name returns an address, that name can be passed into code for object creation. The code
for <samp>:!terminal</samp> is defined in <a href="./source/io_common.html#!terminal">io_common.html</a>
</p>
<pre><samp>
		m: ( class --)
			%%terminal @
			heap_object_free
			heap_object %%terminal !
		; method :!terminal
</samp></pre>
<a name="instance_variable"><h3>instance_variables</h3></a>

<p>
Instance variable names by convention should start with
<samp>%%</samp>, and as they are not ansi standard words they should continue with lower case names.
</p>

<p>
<samp>class</samp> puts on the stack the alignment and length of the
object created by the parent object, that instance_variables add to this, and that end_class saves off
the alignment and length needed by the new class.
</p>
<p>
<samp>instance_variable</samp> is used in the form.
</p>
<pre><samp>
field_type instance_variable name
</samp></pre>
<p>
Valid field types are:
<table>
<tr><th>field_name</th><th>example</th><th>field length</th></tr>
<tr><td>byte%</td><td>byte% instance_variable %%fred</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>word%</td><td>word% instance_variable %%fred</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>cell%</td><td>cell% instance_variable %%fred</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>char%</td><td>char% instance_variable %%fred</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>double%</td><td>double% instance_variable %%fred</td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr><td>bytes%</td><td>n bytes% instance_variable %%fred</td><td>n</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<samp>field_type</samp> puts on the stack two values. The field length and the field alignment.
</p>
<h5>EXAMPLE</h5>
<pre><samp>
base_class class
        cell%     instance_variable %%a_variable

        ................

end_class new_class
</samp></pre>
<p>
If you look at most OO languages they can decide if the data should be public, protected, friend or foe.
<b>COLDFORTH</b> is not confused. <samp>instance_variables</samp>  only have class scope, if you want access to
data outside a class you have to define a method to get at it. Strict enforcement of basic OO Principles brings a lot of advantages. As data access is through
methods, nice behavior is simple to enforce, changed behavior simple to implement.
</p>
<a name="class_binding"><h3>class binding</h3></a>

<p>
If invoking a method at runtime is fast ( and it is) class binding can be used to introduce bugs and little
more.
</p>
<p>
Lets use the <samp>string_class</samp>  and <samp>:print</samp> to demonstrate class binding.
If you create a string object and then invoke
the <samp>:print</samp> you will invoke the <samp>string_class</samp> <samp>:print</samp> method.
</p>
<pre><samp>
CREATE fred ," fred"
fred COUNT string_class dictionary_object fred_string
0 fred_string :print
</samp></pre>
<p>
The following code will invoke the <samp>base_class</samp> version of <samp>:print</samp>.
</p>
<pre><samp>
0 fred_string bind base_class :print
</samp></pre>
<p>
You can also pull the same trick in a colon word using <samp>[bind]</samp>.
</p>
<pre><send>
: base_print ( offset object ) [bind] base_class :print ;
</send></pre>
<p>
The potential for error should be obvious. A programmer overrides <samp>:print</samp> because
something has changed, lurking in the application is a word that uses <samp>:print</samp> from past generations.
</p>
<a name="public"><h3>public and private</h3></a>
<p>
Instance variables can only be private, forth words that use <samp>this</samp> should be private,
and methods can be public or private.
</p>
<p>
Within a class you switch between public and private with the words <samp>public</samp> and <samp>private</samp>.
</p>
<h5>EXAMPLE</H5>
<pre><samp>

        \ this is private
        cell% instance_variable %%fred

        \ these are public

</samp></pre>
<p>
Private words are stored in class vocabularies, you can get access to the private vocabularies
with the word <a href="./source/objects.html#look"><samp>look</samp></a>.
</p>
<a name="base_class"><h3>base_class</h3>
<p>
The base class is called <samp>base_class</samp>. <samp>base_class</samp> has three methods,
<samp>:construct</samp>, <samp>:destruct</samp> and <samp>:print</samp>.
</p>
<a name="string_class"><h3>string_class</h3></a>

<p>
A HTML server has to be able to support very long stringS. The standard <b>COLDFORTH</b> string words only support
256 character strings. To deal with this the
<a href="./source/string_class.html">string_class</a> was introduced. This section covers it use.
</p>
<a name="string_class_construct"><h4>constructing a string</h4></a>
<p>
You use the standard object construction words.  The construct word expects
you to provide the address of a string and the string count.
</p>
<h5>EXAMPLE</h5>
<p>
To create a string from free buffer.
</p>
<pre><samp>
CREATE $default ," default"
$default COUNT string_class heap_object
</pre></samp>
<p>
this code will return the address of the new object
</p>
<p>
You can create the object in the dictionary, this is the thing to do if the object has
to exist while the program exists. The actual string is still stored in a free buffer.
</p>
<h5>EXAMPLE</h5>
<pre><samp>
CREATE $default ," default"
$default COUNT string_class dictionary_object fred
</samp></pre>
<p>
The object is stored in the dictionary, the string is saved int a free buffer.
If you create the object with a null string no free buffer is allocated.
</p>
<h5>EXAMPLE</h5>
<pre><samp>
0 0 string_class dictionary_object fred1
</samp></pre>
<p>
Once created you can call the following methods
</p>
<table>
<tr><th>method</th><th>stack</th><th>operation</th></tr>
<tr><td><a href="./source/string_class.html#string@"><samp>:string@</samp></a></td><td>object--addr n</td><td>Return string address and count.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="./source/string_class.html#string!"><samp>:string!</samp></a></td><td>addr n object--</td><td>Replace current string data with new data</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="./source/string_class.html#string_delete"><samp>:string_delete</samp></a></td><td>offset n object --</td>
                 <td>delete n characters of string data from the offset.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="./source/string_class.html#string_insert"><samp>:string_insert</samp></a></td><td>addr n offset object --</td>
                <td>Insert the string described by addr and n into the
                  string at offset.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="./source/string_class.html#string+"><samp>:string+</samp></a></td><td>add n object --</td><td>Add the address of the string described by addr and n to the
                  end of the string.</td></tr>

</table>
<p>
This small set of methods is large enough to build all string manipulation words.
</p>
<a name="link_class"><h3>link_class</h3></a>
<p>
The linked object class is the one to use if you want to link objects together. To understand this class
you you have to focus on <samp>overrides</samp>. This class gets it head through the method <samp>:list_head</samp>.
The <samp>:construct</samp> method uses the <samp>:list_head</samp> method to get the list head that the object is to be
linked into.
</p>
<p>
Child classes override the link list head by overriding :list_head.
</p>
<p>
<samp>link_class</samp> defines <a href="./source/link_class.html#link_to_object">link&gt;object</a> to
convert the link list address to an object base. Once you have the
object base you can call any method in the object.
</p>
<p>
<a href="./source/tcp/proto.html#dot_protocols"><samp>.protocols</samp></a> is an example of a word
that uses a linked list of objects. In this example each protocol class defines a <samp>:print</samp> method that
details the protocol, .protocol traces down the linked list of protocol objects calling the <samp>:print</print>
methods.
</p>
