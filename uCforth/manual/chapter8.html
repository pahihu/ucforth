<h1>COLDFORTH MANUAL CHAPTER 8 Input/Output</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
To input data,  a program uses <a HREF="./source/input_output.html#ACCEPT">ACCEPT</a>, to output data
a program uses <a HREF="./source/input_output.html#TYPE">TYPE</a>. Behind these two simple words is an
I/O sub system that allows you to talk to a serial device, a file, a TCP connection or a pipe to another task.
This chapter tries to walk you through the maze.
</p>
<p>
If you look at the code for <a HREF="./source/input_output.html#ACCEPT">ACCEPT</a> you will note that an object address is obtained from the user variable 'input_file
and one of two methods  are called, <samp>:read_line</samp> or <samp>:read</samp>. Default actions for these two methods
are defined in the class <samp>io_common</samp>. All io classes are derived from io_common. If you can read data
from the io device, <samp>:read_line</samp> and <samp>:read</samp> will be overridden when the class is defined,
with a method that will get the data from the device.
</p>
<p>
<samp>TYPE</samp> obtains the object address from the user variable 'output_file, <samp>TYPE</samp> then calls the objects
<samp>:type</samp> method.
</p>
<p>
<samp>TYPE</samp> and <samp>EXPECT</samp> are used as ansi standard words that call I/O object methods using
objects stored in predefined locations. The ansi standard file words such as
<a HREF="./source/input_output.html#READ-FILE">READ-FILE</a> and
<a HREF="./source/input_output.html#WRITE-FILE">WRITE-FILE</a> take a file-id.
The file-id is an i/o object address, and just
like <samp>TYPE</samp>, <samp>FILE-WRITE</samp> calls an io object method .
The the method called by <samp>TYPE</samp> (<samp>:type</samp>) maintains a character position,
the method called by <samp>WRITE-FILE</samp> (<samp>:write</samp>) doesn't.
</p>
<p>
In other words the use of object has unified the FORTH I/O word set. The set specified for terminal I/O use an object
whose address is stored in a user variable, the file word set use an object address supplied on the stack. Both word sets
can operate against the same set of objects.
</P>
<p>
You can use the methods directly, use of the ANSI standard words is recommended. There use will now be covered.
</p>
<a name="files"><h2>Files</h2></a>
<p>
The file word set deals with i/o objects. When you open a file you get a handle, the handle is the address of
an object created on the heap. When you close a file you destroy an object. A file can be a TCP/IP port, a pipe,
a NFS file or a file stored in flash. In all cases the file words call method in the object created with open.
Some of the file words have no meaning for some types of I/O devises, for instance you can't reposition the file
pointer if your using
the object to write data to a TCP/IP connection. Generally if the file word has no meaning when used against
a particular I/O device the stack is tidied up and no
action is taken.
<a name="file_creation"><h3>Creating a file</h3></a>
<p>
First you need to create a file. The ansi standard word is <a HREF="./source/input_output.html#CREATE-FILE">CREATE-FILE</a>,
unfortunately this requires on the stack the address and count of a string that describes
the file to be made, not that easy to give in interpreting mode.
<b>COLDFORTH</b> supplies the word <samp>mkfile</samp> used in the form <samp>mkfile ( "name" --)</samp>.
</p>
<h5>EXAMPLE</h5>
<pre><samp>
R/W mkfile flash/test.html
</samp></pre>
<p>
<samp>mkfile</samp> is followed by a string that is used to create the new file. The first "/" divides the string into
two parts, the first part specifies the driver to be used, the second is a string that is passed to the driver.
A driver is nothing more than a class name stored in the vocabulary <samp>&drivers</samp>. The open word uses
the class to create an I/O object.  This is an important point, <b><samp>open</samp> creates objects,
<samp>close</samp> destroys objects</b>.
</p>
<p>
As is common with the <b>COLDFORTH</b> file word set <samp>mkfile</samp> comes in three flavors.
</p>
<table>

         If all is ok <samp>ior</samp> is zero and <samp>handle</samp> is the base address of an object giving access to
         the file.

         the next input token as the file name. If an error occurs abort.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The <samp>mkfile</samp> word set creates the file but does not leave the file in an open state.
</p>
<a name="file_opening"><h3>Opening a file</h3></a>
<p>
Once created the file has to be opened, once again there is an ANSI standard word and
a set of three <b>COLDFORTH</b> words.
</p>
<p>
The ansi word set provides an error code if failure occurs, the <b>COLDFORTH</b> word set
about.

<h5>EXAMPLE</h5>
<pre><samp>
VARIABLE %file_handle
R/W open flash/test.html %file_handle !
</samp></pre>
<P>
On opening the file position pointer points to the first byte ( position zero).
</p>
<p>
The file handle is still valid even if you abort. In this case we have stored it in a variable for later use.
</p>
<a name="file_writing"><h3>File Writing</h3></a>
<p>
Now we have a handle we can write to a file.
 You can use the object method
<a href="./source/io_common.html#:write">:write</a>, or the ansi standard word
, <a HREF="./source/input_output.html#WRITE-FILE">WRITE-FILE</a>.
</p>
<table>

        Write a string to a file at the current file position, if an error occurs return the address of an error string</td></tr>
</table>
<h5>EXAMPLE</h5>
<pre><samp>
CREATE $fred ,"a string"
$fred COUNT %file_handle @ WRITE-FILE $ABORT
</samp></pre>
<a name="file_position"><h3>File position</h3></a>
<p>
In this section we will discuss three ansi standard words, they all call methods within the io object. All the methods
will abort on error. In all cases the abort is converted to an ior as required by the ansi standard.
</p>
<p>
When you open a file the file position is at the start of the file. When you read or write to a file the
file position is after the read or write data. You can get the current file position with the word
<a href="./source/input_output.html#FILE-POSITION"><samp>FILE-POSITION</samp></a>.
<h5>EXAMPLE</h5>
<pre><samp>
%file_handle @ FILE-POSITION
\ consume ior
$ABORT
\ consume file position
D.
</samp></pre>
<p>
When you read and write to a file you do so from the current file position. When you open a file
the file has been positioned to the start of the file.
</p>
<p>
<a href="./source/input_output.html#REPOSITION-FILE"><samp>REPOSITION-FILE</samp></a> is the ansi word used to move the
position pointer. <a href="./source/input_output.html#FILE-SIZE"><samp>FILE-SIZE</samp></a> can be used to get the size
of a file. The following code can be used to position the file pointer to the end of a file, for a file
append.
</p>
<h5>EXAMPLE</h5>
<pre><samp>
%file_handle @ FILE-SIZE
$ABORT  \ abort if we fail
\ file_size(--
%file_handle @ REPOSITION-FILE
$ABORT \ abort if we fail
</samp></pre>
<table>
<tr><th>word</th><th>stack</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><a HREF="./source/input_output.html#FILE-POSITION"><samp>FILE-POSITION</samp></a></td><td>handle--double ior</td>
        <td>If ior is zero double is the current file position,if ior is non zero ior is a string describing the
        problem and double is undefined.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a HREF="./source/input_output.html#FILE-SIZE"><samp>FILE-SIZE</samp></a></td><td>handle--double ior</td>
         <td>If ior is zero, handle gives the file size in characters, if the file is none zero ior is
         the address of a string that describes the error, and double is undefined.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a HREF="./source/input_output.html#REPOSITION-FILE"><samp>REPOSITION-FILE</samp></a></td><td>double handle--ior</td>
        <td>If ior is zero the file position is set to the double value. If ior is non zero, ior is the address
        of a string describing the problem.</td></tr>
</table>
<a name="file_read"><h3>File read</h3></a>
<p>
If you have followed the example so far, you have the file <i>test.html</i> on flash, the file is open with the
handle stored in %file_handle, we have written a string, and the file is positioned at the end.
We are now going to read the written data.
</p>
<h5>EXAMPLE</h5>
<pre><samp>
\ somewhere to put the read data
ram_create %buffer 20 ram_allot
\ position back to start
0 S>D %file_handle @ REPOSTION-FILE
\ get rid of ior
$ABORT
\ read some data from the file
%buffer 8 %file_handle @ READ-FILE
\ get rid of ior
$ABORT
\ look at the read count
.
\ look at the buffer
%buffer 10 DUMP
</samp></pre>
<p>
In the buffer you should find the data written to file above, that is "a string"
</p>
<p>
You can also read a line of data from a file with <a href="./source/input_output.html#READ-LINE"><samp>READ-LINE</samp></a>.
</p>
<a name="file_append"><h3>Append to a file</h3>
<p>
We have already covered all the words needed to do this.
</p>
<pre><samp>
%file_handle @ FILE-SIZE
$ABORT  \ abort if we fail
\ file_size(--
%file_handle @ REPOSITION-FILE
$ABORT \ abort if we fail
\ add a second copy of the string
$fred COUNT %file_handle @ WRITE-FILE $ABORT
\ reposition back to start
\ position back to start
0 S>D %file_handle @ REPOSTION-FILE
\ get rid of ior
$ABORT
\ read some data from the file
%buffer $10 %file_handle @ READ-FILE
\ get rid of ior
$ABORT
\ look at the read count
.
\ look at the buffer
%buffer $10 DUMP
</samp></pre>
<p>
The buffer should now contain the string, twice.
</p>
<a name="file_shrink"><h3>Shrinking the file.</h3>
<p>
You can reduce the file length with the word <a href="./source/input_output.html#RESIZE-FILE"><samp>RESIZE-FILE</samp></a>.
The following example removes the data appended above.
</p>
<pre><samp>
8 S>D %file_handle @ RESIZE-FILE
$ABORT
%file_handle @ FILE-SIZE
$ABORT
D.
</samp></pre>
<a name="file_using"><h3>Using the file for standard I/O words</h3>
<p>
We mentioned in the introduction that the I/O system has been unified under <b>COLDFORTH</b>, this allows us to
open a file and send standard output to the file for printing.
</p>
<pre><samp>
%file_handle @
\ write data using standard word.
'output_file ! 1234 . 'abort_file @ 'output_file !

0 S>D %file_handle @  REPOSITION-FILE $ABORT
%buffer $10 READ-FILE $ABORT
.
%buffer $10 DUMP
</samp></pre>
<p>
You should see our original string and the data written above now stored in <samp>%buffer</samp>.
</p>
<p>
We will now get a little bit more adventurious. <samp>.tasks</samp> prints a list of running tasks
lets write that data to a file.
</p>
<pre><samp>
\ clean out the file
0 S>D %file_handle @ RESIZE-FILE
%file_handle @
\ write data using standard word.
'output_file ! .tasks  'abort_file @ 'output_file !

0 S>D %file_handle @  REPOSITION-FILE $ABORT
HERE $100 %file_handle @ READ-FILE $ABORT
.
HERE $100 DUMP
</samp></pre>
<p>
This small code segment demonstates the advantages of unifying the I/O system. <samp>.tasks</samp> was written
to work against files, it's just another word to print system info. But because of what <b>COLDFORTH</b> is
<samp>.task</samp> can be used to write the state of the current running tasks to a file, or for that matter
to a TCP/IP connection, or to a pipe.
</p>
<p>
Our little test file now contains data. Lets write a word to display it and display it.  Note
that we still have the file open when we use the display word. You can have multiple
objects pointing to one file.
</p>
<pre><samp>
: display {  ( "name" --) }{ variable %handle }
        open  %handle !
        #$buffer get_buffer
        BEGIN
           buffer #$buffer %handle @ READ-LINE ?DUP IF
                \ we had an error reading
                kill_buffer
                %handle @ close
                $ABORT
           THEN
        WHILE
                buffer SWAP TYPE CR
        REPEAT
        kill_buffer
        %handle @ close
;

display flash/test.html
</samp></pre>
<p>
<a href="./source/input_output.html#display"><samp>display</samp></a> is almost usefull enough to be a
kernel word, it is.
</p>
</samp></pre>
<a name="file_delete"><h3>Removing a file</h3>
<p>
Lets now close our file and <a href="./source/input_output.html#remove"><samp>remove</samp></a> it.
</p>
<h5>EXAMPLE</h5>
<pre><samp>
%file_handle @ close
remove flash/test.html
</samp></pre>
<p>
remove comes in a few flavors.
</p>
<table>
<tr><th>word</th><th>stack</th><th>Description</th></tr>

        <td>Remove a file using
         the next input token as the file name. If an error occurs abort.</td></tr>
</table>
<a name="nfs"><h3>Using nfs</h3></a>
<p>
MFS is the distributed file protocol used by UNIX. UNIX expects devices to be mounted before use. Each <b>COLDFORTH</b>
task can have a remove nfs drive mounted.
</p>
<h5>EXAMPLE</h5>
<pre><samp>
\ mount a remote nfs drive
mount 192.168.0.112/home/charlese/bcm550/version081
\ make a file on the device
mkfile nfs/test.html
\ open the file
R/W  open nfs/test.html
%file_handle !

%file_handle @
\ write data using standard word.
'output_file ! context @ null (words)
'output_file @ close
'abort_file @ 'output_file !
</samp></pre>
<p>
The above code writes the words list to a NFS file.
</p>
<p>
The mount string can be embedded inteh file specification. The above example can be rewritten.
</p>
<pre><samp>
mkfile nfs/192.168.0.112/home/charlese/bcm550/version081:test.html
R/W open nfs/192.168.0.112/home/charlese/bcm550/version081:test.html
%file_handle !
etc.
</samp></pre>
<p>
You could also write this:
</p>
<pre><samp>
swd nfs/192.168.0.112/home/charlese/bcm559/version081:
mkfile ./test.html
R/W open ./test.html
%file_handle !
etc.
</samp></pre>
</body>
