<h1>COLDFORTH MANUAL CHAPTER 9</h1>
<h2>TCP/IP</h2>
<p>
TCP/IP is implemented to varied standards, some implementations offer the
bear minimum, some such as the linux stack go all the way. The COLDFORTH
stack is in the middle. It supports multiple connections from multiple machines,
broadcasting, routing, fragmentation and defragmentation. There are available many
print words to allow you to determine the state of the system.
</p>
<h3>General</h3>
<h4>Routing</h4>
<p>
An ip packet will be sent to a host on the local network or to a gateway, there is
no other option. An ip packet gets from a box in New York to a box in Bacchus March by being sent
to gateways until it arrives at a gateway connected to the destination network. The final gateway sends the
datagram to the host.
</p>
<p>
Because TCP/IP lays on top of other protocols, the datagram can be sent to a host or a gateway
without changing the ip address. In other words, if a gateway has an ip address 123.16.4.12
and the desired datagram destination is 65.24.3.1 , we don't send the datagram to 123.16.4.12, we
send it to the same hardware address as we send datagrams destined for 123.16.2.12. The gateway looks
at the received datagrams ip and says "hay this is not for me. it doesn't have an ip address 123.16.4.12",
the gateway then looks at it's routing tables and sends it on.
</p>
<p>
The introduction of the ip address above the hardware address leads to the
simplicity of tcp/ip routing, the simplicity of the routing led to the success of TCP/IP.
</p>
<h3>.ip_stats</h3>
<p>
All packets dealt with by a <b>COLDFORTH</b> system qo through the routing task. Packets
that come from interfaces, packets that are genreated locally, all packets.
</p>
<p>
Faulty stuctured packets are dropped whilebefore being being placed on the queue, and
error counters are incremented. <samp>.ip_stats</samp> prints out the value of these counts.
</p>

</table>
<h4>Fragmentation</h4>
<p>
If the destination host is connected to the COLDFORTH system on a local network segment,
coldforth sends datagrams using the <i>mtu</i> ( maximum transfer unit) for the interface.
If the datagram is destined for the internet it uses a default mtu that all internet
devices are supposed to be able to handle.
</p>
<p>
Datagrams larger that the mtu can be generated by an application, the interface will then fragment
the datagram. An example is NFS ( Network file system), this application generates 8k datagrams, ethernet
has to transfer such datagrams in smaller packets, to do this the interface fragments the datagrams. The system
expects the receiving host to put a fragmented datagram back together again.
</p>
<p>
Fragments can bring down poorly designed TCP/IP stacks, and place unacceptable
load on well designed stacks. To understand why one needs to consider the basic
assumptions that need to be made when designing the defragmentation system.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Datagrams can arrive in any order.</li>
<li>You can get multiple copies of a datagram</li>
<li>Datagrams can live in the internat for a couple off minutes.</li>
<li>You can have an unlimited number of conversations running at any one time</li>
<li>The minimum fragment size is 8 bytes.</li>
<li>The maximum datagram size is 64k.</li>
</ol>
<p>
To do all this, fragments have to by queued until all fragments arrive.
Getting a latter fragment first doesn't mean we aren't going to get the initial
fragment latter, so all we can do is queue and hope. Multiple copies
of the same fragment have to be detected and destroyed. The can be an unlimited
number of partially reconstructed datagrams active. Datagrams partially received
have to be timed out after a couple of minutes and the resources used to save the
datagrams returned to the system.
</p>
<p>
A minimalistic stack will not support defragmentation, a rough stack will die when
presented with extremes, a quality stack will place limits on the resources that can
be used by the defragmentation system. COLDFORTH does the latter.
<p>
Because of the difficulties some firewalls don't let datagram fragments through.
</p>
<p>
If the <i>don't defrag</i> bit isn't set a gateway has the option of fragmenting  a datagram. Once fragmented
a datagram isn't reconstructed until the destination is reached.
</p>
<h3>arp</h3>
<p>
The address resolution protocol deals with a local network. All boxes on the local network have to
resolve the hardware addresses used to send ip addresses. They do this under various circumstances.
If a packet arrives from the network, the receiving interface creates an arp entry for the sending box.
This makes sense, a box receiving an ip datagram is likely to want to send a reply.
</p>
<p>
If an interface receives a datagram to send to an ip on the local network and it doesn't know the
hardware address it immediately has to try and get one. The interface does this by broadcasting an
arp request, <i> Hat you lot, I need the hardware address of the box that owns this ip address</i>.
The owner of the ip address must reply.
</p>
<p>
Because the whole tcp/ip protocol suite is written on the assumption that datagrams can be lost
the interface has the option of dropping datagrams if it doesn't know the hardware address of the destination
box. This serverly degrades performance. COLDFORTH queues the datagrams for transmission when the destination
box replies to the arp request.
</p>
<p>
The COLDFORTH interface code is an object. The route_ip task calls methods in the interface object if the
datagram is routed to the interface. So it will be the route_ip task that will send out an arp request and
queue the ip datagram for an arp reply if there is no arp entry. It will be the route_ip task that will
place an ip datagram in the interface transmit queue, or transfer it to the hardware if the hardware
is fastenough and in a fit state.
</p>
<p>
The hardware interrupt code will deal with arp replies, transferring packets waiting for the arp reply to the
send queue or the hardware using the received hardware address.
</p>
<h3>.arp</h3>
<p>
The state of the arp table can be seen with .arp. The following
example shows a .arp printout for a running system.
</p>
<pre>
flash RTI1000  OPERATOR &root FORTH 10>.arp

C0A80084  0010B5973745 Resolved     101
C0A80070  00E018803E34 Resolved     38
</pre>
<p>
Note that in the above table all ip address's are on the same segment, and
that the uncompleted entry has one datagram queued for transmission when
the entry is resolved.
</p>
<p>
Also note that the ttl ( time to live) entries. The time to live entry drop
with time. Receiving datagrams from the box updates the entry. If the time falls
below a minimum value an arp request is sent. Hopefully an arp reply will arrive
before the entry timeout and the time updated.
</p>
<p>
Entries are timed out so machines that have there hardware changed are not lost
to other machines until the other machine has a reset. Remember these standards
were designed with the assumption that computeres can run unstopped fro years.
Not the assumption that a daily reboot is required.
</p>

<h3>ethernet hardware addresses</h3>
<p>
The ethernet hardware address is controlled by a standard. Originally the 802 standard
was defined for world wide communication and a 48 bit address was assigned. If we call the
low bit bit of the 48 bit address bit zero, and the high bit, bit 47, then bits 47 and 46
of the address have special meanings. Bit 47 is set for group addressing and bit 46
is set to zero for IEEE administered addresses and is set to one for locally
administered addresses.
</p>
<p>
History took over, a protocol with a 32 bit address ( TCP/IP) is used to communicate
around the world, and the 48 bit IEEE 802 address is used on local segments. A globally unique
address is not needed.
</p>
<p>
COLDFORTH assigns the MAC address on startup; the top byte is set to $40, so the generated address
is standard compliant, the next 5 bytes are set to a random value. For this system to work the
tcp/ip address resolution protocol on all machines communicating to a COLDFORTH system have to
work as the hardware address changes on a reboot.
</p>
<p>
You can set the hardware address to a known value in the interface startup file.
</p>
<p>
The following code prints out an example nice setup file. In the example the hardware
address is set to @10827.
</p>
<pre>
flash/init RTI1000  OPERATOR &root FORTH 10>CR display ./nice_setup.html
\ change the numbers to the cards serial number
CREATE $nif ," @10827"
$nif OVER $set_nif
\ change to desired ip address
192.168.0.111 OVER set_ip
\ change to desired netmask
$FFFFFF00 OVER set_mask
</pre>
<h3>.route</h3>
<p>
Datagrams sent and received are routed. The result of routing is the calling
of an interface object. If the datagram is for the COLDFIRE system the <i>local
interface</i> is asked to consume it. If the datagram is to go somewhere a interface
that will put the datagram on the appropriate wire is used.
</p>
<p>
In a COLDFORTH system routes can be created in two ways. From a ICMP redirect message
and as a static route request. Routes added by a ICMP redirect message are timed
out. Static routes remain forever. The following table shows a .route printout.
</p>

</pre>
<p><b>
The above set of routes was set up with the following code:
</b></p>
<p>
The defaults allow us to communicate over the nice network. There is no default
gateway, that has to be set in routing.html.
Datagrams destined for the local machine; have to go to the local interface
we extract the address from the nice_object so it only has to be set in one
file; nice_setup.html.
</p>
<pre>
%nice_object @ :ip @   \ ip
$FFFFFFFF              \ mask
$00000000 $00000000 $00000000 %local_object @ static_route
</pre>
<p>
Datagrams broadcast to the local network go to the :broadcast method. This will see
if the datagram came in on the network, if so it is sent to the local interface, if
not it is sent out onto the wire.
</p>
<pre>
\ set the host portion to all one's
%nice_object @ :ip @
%nice_object @ :@netmask -1 XOR OR  \ ip
$FFFFFFFF                    \ mask
$00000000 $00000000 $00000000 %nice_object @ broadcast_route
</pre>
<p>
Datagrams destined to the local network have to go to the network. There is no gateway
involved.
The following entry will be found after the above two because the mask is less
specific.
</p>
<pre>
%nice_object @ :ip @ %nice_object @ :@netmask AND  \ ip, set the host portion to zero
%nice_object @ :@netmask                           \ mask
$00000000 $00000002 $00000000 %nice_object @   static_route
</pre>
<p>
Now the extreme low level stuff. The system uses the routing table for all datagram routing.
There has to be entries for local loopback.
</p>
<pre>
127.000.000.000 $FF000000 $00000000 $00000000 $00000000 %loopback_object @ static_route

<h3>The local interface</h3>
<p>
We have mentioned that datagrams destined for the local host are sent to the
local interface. The local interface deals with defragmentation. When a datagram
is complete the local interface queues it onto the proto queue to be dealt with by the
proto task.
</p>
<h3>.local_interface</h3>
<p>
The state of the local interface can be seen with the word .local_interface.
The output is shown below.

<h3>printing out a demux object</h3>
<p>
When a tcp packet arrives at the local machine the demux objects are used to whork out
which tcp opbject should take the packet. Servers take packets from particular ports
but from all machines. Servers start tasks that take packets from particular ports and
machines. <b>COLDFORTH</b> naturally supports multi threaded operation. Each thread
can have the connection connected as it's standard I/O device. The standard print words
such as TYPE and ACCEPT can then be used to output and input data.
</p>
<p>
You use .tcp_demux to get a list of the active demux objects. The object colume contains
the object address of the object that will consume the packet.
