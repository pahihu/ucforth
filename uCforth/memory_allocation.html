<h3>Memory Allocation</h3>
<a HREF="./license.html">license</a>
<p>
The fast area is common to all task so the allocations pointers have to
be in the lib data space as this is the only area common. This only
works it the fast memory area is looked after by uCforth.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
\ the facility must be claimed before the task has access
\ To claim use get_facility
create_facility %fast_facility

\ These need to be  set at compile time
\ if the libary init code is to remain empty,
\ to this end they are defined in the data
\ area.
data_variable %fast		#fast_base %fast t!
data_variable %fast_top         #fast_base #fast_size + %fast_top t!
data_variable %fast_base        #fast_base %fast_base t!

<p>( -- addr )</p>
<p>
addr is the text-space pointer.
</p>
<p>
A system guarantees that a region of text space allocated using ALLOT, , (comma)
, C, (c-comma), and ALIGN shall be contiguous with the last region
allocated with one of the above words, unless the restrictions in the following paragraphs apply. The
text-space pointer HERE always identifies the beginning of the next
text-space region to be allocated. As successive allocations
are made, the text-space pointer increases. A program may perform
address arithmetic within contiguously allocated regions. The
last region of text space allocated using the above operators
may be released by allocating a corresponding negatively-sized region
using ALLOT, subject to the restrictions of the following paragraphs.
</p>
<p>
CREATE establishes the beginning of a contiguous region of text space,
whose starting address is returned by the created
definition. This region is terminated by compiling the next definition.
</p>
<p>
Since an implementation is free to allocate text space for use by code,
the above operators need not produce contiguous regions of
text space if definitions are added to or removed from the
dictionary between allocations. An ambiguous condition exists if
deallocated memory contains definitions.
</p>

<p>
The text space of a Forth system comes in discontinuous regions!
The location of some regions is provided by the system, some by
the program. Data space is contiguous within regions, allowing
address arithmetic to generate valid addresses only within a single
region. A Standard Program cannot make any assumptions about the relative
placement of multiple regions in memory.
</p>
Section 3.3.3.2 does prescribe conditions under which contiguous regions
of text space may be obtained. For example:
<p>
<pre> <samp>
        CREATE TABLE   1 C, 2 C, ALIGN 1000 , 2000 ,
</samp> </pre>
<p>
makes a table whose address is returned by TABLE. In accessing this table,
</p>
<pre> <samp>
TABLE C@                        will return 1
TABLE CHAR+ C@                  will return 2
TABLE 2 CHARS + ALIGNED @       will return 1000
TABLE 2 CHARS + ALIGNED CELL+ @ will return 2000.
</pre> </samp>
<p>
Similarly,
</p>
<pre>
<samp>
        CREATE DATA   1000 ALLOT
</samp>
</pre>
<p>
makes an array 1000 address units in size. A more portable strategy would define the array in application units, such as:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>
        500 CONSTANT NCELLS
        CREATE CELL-DATA  NCELLS CELLS ALLOT
</samp>
</pre>
<p>
This array can be indexed like this:
</p>
<pre>
<samp>
        : LOOK   NCELLS 0 DO  CELL-DATA I CELLS + ? LOOP ;
</samp>
</pre>
<h4>MEMORY AREAS</h4>
<p>
There are four spaces. The dictionary space, ram space,
data space and the fast space.
The dictionary space is intended to be used for code,
and the ram space for variables. The area of the dictionary
remembered is checksummed on restart and it is considered an error if checksumming fails.
</p>
<p>
The dictionary space can be written to by a program but it is unwise.
</p>
<p>
The variable space is reset to zero on a restart.
</p>
<pre>
<samp>
To allocate 10 bytes of dictionary space you use the pair:
	CREATE 10 ALLOT
This area may be written to at compile time but not there after.

To allocate ram_variable space
	ram_create 10 ram_allot

To allocate fast memory:
	fast_create 10 fast_allot

<p><b>uCforth</b>. The last statement is a destruction of the
