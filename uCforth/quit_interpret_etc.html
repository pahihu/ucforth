<p>
Save the current input source specification. Store minus-one (-1) in SOURCE-ID
if it is present. Make the string described by c-addr and u both the
input source and input buffer, set >IN to zero, and interpret.
When the parse area is empty, restore the prior input source specification.
Other stack effects are due to the words EVALUATEd.

<p>
Make the user input device the input source. Receive input into the terminal
input buffer, replacing any previous contents. Make the result,
whose address is returned by TIB, the input buffer. Set >IN to zero.
</p>
<p>
Note: This word is obsolescent and is included as a concession to existing
implementations.
</p>
<p>
<b>uCforth</b> Was never fixed up in the standard, it should have been.
As defined here you can interpret QUERY from a file ( call it a script file)
and get one line of user input. Hardly a useless function.
</b>
<p>
Note we get a buffer and kill a buffer. If about doesn't return buffers
we will end up with a memory leakage.
</p>
	<pre> <code>
    : QUERY ( --)
	save_stream
			0 SOURCE-ID !
			#$buffer get_buffer
			buffer %tib !
			0 %line !
			buffer DUP buffer_size  send ACCEPT #TIB ! 0 >IN !
			scan
			kill_buffer
    	restore_stream

<h5>6.1.2050 QUIT</h5>
<p>CORE</p>
<p>( -- )  ( R:  i*x -- )</p>
<p>
Empty the return stack, store zero in SOURCE-ID if it is present,
make the user input device the input source, and enter interpretation state.
Do not display a message. Repeat the following:
</p>
<p>
Accept a line from the input source into the input buffer, set >IN to zero,
and interpret. Display the implementation-defined system prompt if in
interpretation state, all processing has been completed, and no ambiguous
condition exists.
</p>
<p>
<b>uCforth</b> The code below is clearly non standard, but it is clearly the way
it is going to stay. Emptying the return stack is aborts problem not <i>QUIT</i>s.
ABORT deals with the restart in all task, <i>QUIT</i>s use is limited to those that
are set up to use the forth interpretor. If <i>QUIT</i> is used in some other
context other than after an abort then what advantage is there in not returning
to the calling code.
</p>
<p>
To ask for data before the first prompt is really not a very sensible thing to do.

<p>Compilation: Perform the execution semantics given below.</p>

<p>Execution: ( "ccc&lt;paren&gt;" -- )</p>

<p>Parse ccc delimited by ) (right parenthesis). ( is an immediate word.</p>
<p>
The number of characters in ccc may be zero to the number of
characters in the parse area.</p>
<p>
When parsing from a text file, if the end of the parse area is reached
before a right parenthesis is found, refill the input buffer from the
next line of the file, set >IN to zero, and resume parsing, repeating
this process until either a right parenthesis is found or the end
of the file is reached.
