<h5>ANS 16.6.1.2460 WORDLIST</h5>
<p>( -- wid )</p>
<p>
Create a new empty word list, returning its word list identifier wid.
The new word list may be returned from a pool of preallocated word lists
or may be dynamically allocated in data space.
A system shall allow the creation of at least 8 new word lists in
addition to any provided as part of the system.
</p>
<p>
uCforth creates the new vocabulary in user space, when you run out of user
space you run out of the potential to use WORDLIST.
