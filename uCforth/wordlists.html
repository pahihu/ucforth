<h5>ANS 16.6.1.1595 FORTH-WORDLIST</h5>
<p>( -- wid )</p>
<p>
Return wid, the identifier of the word list that includes all standard words
provided by the implementation. This word list is initially the compilation
word list and is part of the initial search order.
</p>
<p>
The forth wordlist is being constructed through ghost_forth. If can stay that
way, we create a new wordlist but it points to the same location in the target.
We do not use this wordlist to add to the target so the ghost head values are
of little interest.
</p>
<p>
Because current_target_wordlist is referenced twice ( FORTH-WORDLIST and FORTH)
it is emptied twice.
