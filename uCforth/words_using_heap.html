Having a decent heap manager means we can put transient regions in transient regions.

<a name="PAD"></a>
<h5>ANS 6.2.2000 PAD</h5>
<p>( -- c-addr )</p>
<p>
c-addr is the address of a transient region that can be used to hold data for
intermediate processing.
</p>
<p>
PAD has been available as scratch storage for strings since the earliest Forth
implementations. It was brought to our attention that many programmers are
reluctant to use PAD, fearing incompatibilities with system uses.
PAD is specifically intended as a programmer convenience, however,
which is why we documented the fact that no standard words use it.

To keep with the intent, the kernel doesn't use PAD. But then with $buffer
and kill_buffer available why would an application use it anyway.

<code>


	: PAD ( --addr)
		%(pad) @ ?DUP IF
			EXIT
		THEN
		#$buffer ALLOCATE $abort
		DUP %(pad) !
	;

	: _token ( --addr)
		%(_token) @ ?DUP IF
			EXIT
		THEN
		#$buffer ALLOCATE $abort
		DUP %(_token) !
	;
